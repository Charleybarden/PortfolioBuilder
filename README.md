# PortfolioBuilder

NOTE - PortfolioBuilder.ipynb is old version - use ChatGPT Assignment.ipynb

The purpose of this code is to demonstrate skills in data manipulation,
data analysis and data visualisation.

Using ChatGPT, a brief was created, in the context of creating an investment
portfolio comprised of companies selected by the user.

During company input, the syntax is comprised of ticker symbols separated by commas,
e.g. 'GOOG, TSLA, MSFT, NVDA'

The code then extracts data using Yahoo Finance, and performs analysis from 2010-2015
to find optimal portfolio structure, then applies these weighting to the companies
from 2015-2020.
